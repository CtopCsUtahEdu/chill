BUILD
=====

0. Install Rose using the rose installation instructions given.

1. Edit Makefile.config. Change BUILD_CODEGEN to false if you don't want
   CodeGen+ library to be built.

2. Do "make depend".

3. Optionally, do "make clean" to remove object files or "make veryclean"
   to additionally remove target files.

4. Do "make".


INSTALLATION
============

You can use Omega+ and CodeGen+ in source directory since all links
are already created in bin/, lib/ and include/ subdirectories.

omega/            source directory root
  bin/            command line interface "oc"
  lib/            libraries "libomega.a" and "libcode_gen.a"
  include/
    omega.h       main Omega+ header file
    omega/        Omega+ header files
    basic/        basic utility header files
    code_gen/     CodeGen+ header files

You can also do "make install" to copy necessary files into
/usr/local for root account, or use home directory for other accounts.
